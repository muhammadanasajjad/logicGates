# Digital Logic Simulator

## Overview

The Digital Logic Simulator is an interactive tool that allows users to design, simulate, and analyze digital circuits. Users can create circuits using basic logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR, and XNOR, as well as more complex components like flip-flops and custom reusable chips.

## Features

-   **Drag-and-drop interface** for placing and connecting logic gates
-   **Live simulation** of circuit behavior
-   **Custom component creation** to save and reuse circuit designs
-   **Truth table generation** for circuit analysis
-   **Export and import functionality** to save and share circuit designs
-   **Support for combinational and sequential logic**

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
 git clone https://github.com/muhammadanasajjad/logicGates.git
 cd logicGates
```

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser to start using the simulator.

## How to Use

1. Drag components from the toolbar onto the workspace.
2. Connect gates by clicking on output and input nodes.
3. Run the simulation to see real-time logic evaluations.
4. Save and load circuits for later use.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the interface
-   **p5.js** for rendering and interactions
